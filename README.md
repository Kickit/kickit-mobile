# Kickit Mobile
This repo will serve as the android and iOS codebase for the Kickit Open Source Project Manager. This implementation has been done as a 'create-react-native-app' to increase its accessibility to possible contributors though it may become necessary to eject the application. This landing page will be live at http://kickit.us which will include more information related to the Kickit project and act as a launch point to all other kickit domains and documentation including this repository.

The mobile codebase has no current development as of May 24 but will begin shortly.
